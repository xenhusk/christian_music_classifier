## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Some audio processing libraries may require additional system dependencies:
- **librosa**: Requires FFmpeg
- **essentia**: May require compilation or conda installation

### 2. Prepare Your Audio Files

Organize your music files in the following structure:
```
TrainingData/
├── ChristianMusic/
│   ├── song1.mp3
│   ├── song2.wav
│   └── ...
└── SecularMusic/
    ├── song1.mp3
    ├── song2.wav
    └── ...
```

Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, OPUS, FLAC

## Usage

### 1. Train the Improved Model

```bash
python improved_audio_classifier.py
```

This will:
- Load all audio files from your TrainingData directory
- Extract 65 enhanced audio features from each file
- Apply variance filtering and feature selection (reduces to 30 features)
- Train class-balanced Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- Use cross-validation to select the best model
- Save the improved model to `models/`
- Generate performance visualizations in `visualizations/`


### 2. Test the Improved Model

```bash
python simple_model_test.py
```

This will:
- Compare original vs improved model architectures
- Show performance improvements and bias fixes
- Display detailed model comparison results

### 2.2. Live Demo with Model Comparison

```bash
# Test all models (default: 10 samples per class, 4 workers)
python demo_fixed_model.py

# Test specific model
python demo_fixed_model.py --model improved_audio_classifier_random_forest.joblib

# Test with more samples and faster processing
python demo_fixed_model.py --samples 20 --workers 8

# List available models
python demo_fixed_model.py --list

# Get help
python demo_fixed_model.py --help
```

**Command-line Options:**
- `--model`, `-m`: Test specific model (default: test all models)
- `--samples`, `-s`: Number of samples per class (default: 10)
- `--workers`, `-w`: Number of parallel workers (default: 4)
- `--list`, `-l`: List available models

This will:
- Load and compare multiple models simultaneously
- Extract features using multithreaded parallel processing
- Test random samples from your dataset
- Show side-by-side predictions with confidence scores
- Display per-model accuracy statistics (overall, Christian, Secular)
- Identify the best performing model
- Demonstrate balanced Christian/Secular classification

**Key Insights**:
- Spectral features (MFCC, chroma) most discriminative
- Harmonic and rhythmic patterns distinguish Christian music
- Multiple feature types contribute (no single dominant feature)

## Advantages Over Lyrics-Based Classification

1. **Complete Coverage**: Works with ALL audio files, not just those with lyrics
2. **Offline Operation**: No internet or API dependencies
3. **Language Independent**: Works with any language or instrumental music
4. **Robust**: Doesn't depend on lyrics quality or availability
5. **Fast**: No need to fetch lyrics from external sources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio Loading Errors**
   - Ensure audio files are not corrupted
   - Check file format compatibility
   - Install FFmpeg for MP3 support

2. **Feature Extraction Failures**
   - Check if librosa can load the audio file
   - Verify file permissions
   - Try converting to WAV format

3. **Model Training Issues**
   - Ensure you have both Christian and Secular files
   - Check for sufficient training data (minimum 50 files per class)
   - Verify audio file quality

### Performance Tips

1. **Use WAV files** for fastest processing
2. **Limit duration** to 30 seconds for faster feature extraction
3. **Ensure balanced dataset** (similar number of Christian and Secular files)
4. **Use high-quality audio** for better feature extraction
