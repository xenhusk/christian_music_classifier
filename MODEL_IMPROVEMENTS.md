# Christian Music Classifier - Model Improvements Summary

## üéØ Overview

This document details the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve bias issues and improve the Christian music classifier's ability to correctly predict whether a song is Christian or secular.

## üîç Original Model Issues Identified

### 1. **Label Encoding Problems**
- **Issue**: Diagnostic showed "Christian samples: 0, Secular samples: 0"
- **Root Cause**: Improper string-to-numeric label conversion during feature extraction
- **Impact**: Model couldn't properly distinguish between classes

### 2. **Constant/Low-Variance Features** 
- **Issue**: Features like `duration` and `sample_rate` were constant across all samples
- **Impact**: Provided no discriminative power, added noise to model
- **Count**: 11 low-variance features identified and removed

### 3. **Data Imbalance Bias**
- **Issue**: 371 Christian vs 160 Secular files (2.32:1 ratio)
- **Impact**: Model heavily biased toward predicting Christian music
- **Evidence**: Decision boundary mean score of -0.560 indicating strong bias

### 4. **Feature Engineering Issues**
- **Issue**: 65 features with no selection or filtering
- **Impact**: Noisy features degraded model performance
- **Problem**: No variance filtering or feature selection pipeline

### 5. **Decision Boundary Bias**
- **Issue**: Model predictions: 70.6% Christian, 29.4% Secular (matching training distribution)
- **Impact**: Poor generalization, biased predictions regardless of actual audio content

## ‚úÖ Comprehensive Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Label Encoding** 
```python
# Clear label mapping with both string and numeric versions
audio_files.append({
    'filepath': str(file_path),
    'filename': file_path.name,
    'label': 'Christian',      # String label  
    'label_numeric': 0,        # Numeric label: Christian = 0
    'category': 'Christian'
})

# Proper label extraction during feature processing
y = np.array([file_info['label_numeric'] for file_info in successful_files], dtype=int)
```

### 2. **Removed Constant/Low-Variance Features**
```python
# Variance threshold filtering
variance_selector = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0.01)
X_variance_filtered = variance_selector.fit_transform(X)

# Result: Removed 11 low-variance features
# Remaining: 54 meaningful features from original 65
```

### 3. **Addressed Data Imbalance with Class Balancing**
```python
# Automatic class weight calculation
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=unique_classes, y=y)
# Result: {0: 0.716, 1: 1.656} - Higher weight for minority class (Secular)

# Applied to models
RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced', ...)
SVC(class_weight='balanced', ...)
```

### 4. **Improved Feature Engineering**
```python
# Enhanced features with better discrimination power
features['signal_length_ratio'] = len(y) / (sample_rate * duration)
features['rms_energy_ratio'] = np.sqrt(np.mean(y**2)) / (np.max(np.abs(y)) + 1e-8)
features['spectral_centroid_skew'] = self._skewness(spectral_centroids)

# Individual chroma bins for key detection
chroma_bins = np.mean(chroma, axis=1)
for i in range(12):
    features[f'chroma_bin_{i}'] = float(chroma_bins[i])

# Harmonic-percussive separation
y_harmonic, y_percussive = librosa.effects.hpss(y)
features['harmonic_ratio'] = harmonic_energy / (total_energy + 1e-8)
features['percussive_ratio'] = percussive_energy / (total_energy + 1e-8)
```

### 5. **Advanced Feature Selection**
```python
# Select top K most discriminative features
feature_selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=30)
X_selected = feature_selector.fit_transform(X_scaled, y)

# Result: Reduced from 65 ‚Üí 54 ‚Üí 30 most important features
# Top features: spectral_centroid_mean, spectral_centroid_std, spectral_centroid_skew
```

### 6. **Proper Validation Pipeline**
```python
# Stratified data split to maintain class balance
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Cross-validation for reliable performance estimates
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_selected, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
```
